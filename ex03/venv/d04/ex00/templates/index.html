  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is
    feasible.<br />Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A
    Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
    without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting
    instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several
    existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile,
    reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of
    inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.<br />
    To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters,
    which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what
    they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like *emphasis*. Markdown
     lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of
     text, assuming you’ve ever used email.</p>
  <h2>Inline html</h2>
  <p>Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for
    writing for the web.<br />Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even
    close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small
    subset of HTML tags. The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier
     to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert.
     The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose.
     HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Thus, Markdown’s
      formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain
      text.<br />For any markup that is not covered by Markdown’s syntax, you
      simply use HTML itself. There’s no need to preface it or delimit it to
      indicate that you’re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use the
      tags. Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within
      block-level HTML tags. E.g., you can’t use Markdown-style *emphasis*
      inside an HTML block.<br />Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown
      syntax is processed within span-level tags.</p>
    <h2>Automatic escaping for special characters</h2>
    <p>In HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment. Left
      angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are used to denote HTML
      entities. If you want to use them as literal characters, you must escape
      them as entities, e.g. &lt;, and &amp;.<br />Ampersands in particular are
      bedeviling for web writers. If you want to write about ‘AT&T’, you need to
       write ‘AT&amp;T’. You even need to escape ampersands within URLs.<br />
      Needless to say, this is easy to forget, and is probably the single most
      common source of HTML validation errors in otherwise well-marked-up web
      sites.<br />Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking
      care of all the necessary escaping for you. If you use an ampersand as
      part of an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be
      translated into &amp;.<br />However, inside Markdown code spans and
      blocks, angle brackets and ampersands are always encoded automatically.
      This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML code. (As opposed
       to raw HTML, which is a terrible format for writing about HTML syntax,
      because every single < and & in your example code needs to be escaped.)
